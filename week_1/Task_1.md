### Task 1: Computerised Agents  

In this exercise, we engage in a collaborative activity to explore the concepts of task decomposition, communication, and the foundational components of an intelligent system or agent. Below is a structured academic response to each aspect of the task:

---

### **1. Task Breakdown and Role Distribution**  
The exercise involves simulating a computerised agent using human participants, each assigned a specific sensory or operational function:  

- **Left Eye and Right Eye:** Responsible for observing the environment but incapable of cognitive processing.
- **Left Arm and Right Arm:** Responsible for performing physical actions but devoid of visual or auditory input.
- **Brain:** Central processing unit responsible for interpreting visual information from the "eyes" and issuing instructions to the "arms."  

This role distribution mirrors the structure of an artificial agent with input, processing, and output components, highlighting the significance of clear communication and task delegation in coordinated systems.

### **2. Post-Task Reflection**  

After completing the stacking exercise, a reflective analysis revealed the following:  

#### **a. Issues and Problems Arising During the Task**  
- **Communication Barriers:** A lack of direct interaction between sensory and operational roles led to delays and confusion.  
- **Interpretation Errors:** Ambiguity in the description of object positioning by the "eyes" caused errors in the "brain's" decision-making.  
- **Coordination Challenges:** Sequential delays in conveying instructions caused inefficiencies in real-time operations.  

#### **Improvements for Future Iterations**  
- Implement more structured, precise communication protocols (e.g., pre-defined terminology for positioning and orientation).  
- Allow periodic feedback loops where the "arms" can indicate their progress to ensure accuracy.  
- Introduce a systematic approach to simplify complex descriptions into smaller, actionable steps.

### **3. Simple Agent Design and Analysis**  

#### **b. Main Components of a Simple Agent (e.g., an Ant in a Box)**  
A simple agent, such as an ant in a confined space, would require:  
- **Perception Mechanism:** Basic sensors to detect food presence.  
- **Action Mechanism:** The ability to move towards detected food.  
- **Motivation Function:** An internal drive to seek sustenance.  

#### **c. Problems with a Simple Agent**  
- **Limited Perception:** The agent may fail to detect distant or obscured food.  
- **Rigid Responses:** Without flexibility, the agent may become stuck if obstacles block its path.  
- **Inability to Learn:** The agent lacks the ability to adapt to new conditions or learn from mistakes.  

#### **Enhancements for Improved Intelligence**  
- **Memory:** Introduce a memory system to remember previously explored areas.  
- **Adaptive Learning:** Implement reinforcement learning to improve decision-making over time.  
- **Multiple Sensory Inputs:** Incorporate additional sensors for better environmental awareness.

### **4. Defining Intelligence and Artificial Intelligence**  

#### **d. Meaning of Intelligence**  
- **Biological Intelligence:** The cognitive ability to perceive, learn, reason, and solve problems in dynamic environments.  
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** A branch of computer science that designs systems capable of mimicking human cognitive functions, such as problem-solving, learning, and adaptation.  

### **Group Definition of AI**  
*"Artificial Intelligence refers to the simulation of human-like cognitive abilities by machines, enabling them to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as perception, reasoning, decision-making, and self-improvement based on experience."*

### **Conclusion**  
This exercise highlights the complexity of designing intelligent agents and the importance of effective communication, sensory integration, and adaptability. By understanding the limitations of simple agents and the necessary components for intelligent behavior, we gain insights into the development of more sophisticated AI systems capable of autonomous functioning in real-world scenarios.
