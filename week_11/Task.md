### **Latest Applications of Machine Vision: e-Portfolio Info Sheet**

---

### **Application: Machine Vision in Agriculture (Precision Farming)**

---

#### **1. What is it being used for?**  
- Machine vision systems in agriculture are used to monitor crop health, detect weeds, assess soil quality, and automate harvesting.
- Advanced drones and cameras, equipped with machine vision algorithms, scan large agricultural fields and provide actionable insights in real time.

---

#### **2. How does it work?**  
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** Used for image classification and object detection (e.g., identifying weeds and healthy/unhealthy plants).
- **Semantic Segmentation:** Divides an image into meaningful segments to identify different regions of interest (e.g., plant vs. soil vs. weeds).
- **Spectral Imaging:** Machine vision cameras capture images in different wavelengths (e.g., infrared) to detect early signs of crop disease that may not be visible to the human eye.

#### **3. Real-World Example: Blue River Technology**  
- Blue River Technology (acquired by John Deere) developed the **"See & Spray"** system, a machine vision-based sprayer that can selectively spray herbicides only where weeds are detected.
- **Impact:**  
  - Reduced herbicide use by up to **90%**.
  - Lowered costs for farmers and reduced environmental impact.
  - Increased crop yield by ensuring precise weed elimination without affecting healthy plants.

#### **4. Why is it interesting?**  
- **Sustainability:** Reducing chemical usage makes farming more eco-friendly.  
- **Efficiency:** Large-scale farms can monitor and maintain crops with minimal labor.  
- **Innovation:** Combines drones, computer vision, and AI to create fully autonomous farming solutions.
