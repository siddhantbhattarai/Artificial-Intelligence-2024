### **Task: Machine Learning Types**

There are three primary types of Machine Learning: **Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, and Reinforcement Learning**. Here's a breakdown along with **practical applications** and explanations.

## **1. Supervised Learning**

### **Definition:**  
In supervised learning, the model is trained on labeled data (input-output pairs), where the goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs.

### **Examples of Practical Applications:**

### **1.1 Spam Email Detection (Classification Task)**  
- **What it does:**  
  Detects whether an email is spam or not based on features such as sender information, email content, and subject line.
- **How it works:**  
  The model is trained on a dataset of labeled emails (spam or not spam) using algorithms like Logistic Regression or Decision Trees.

### **1.2 Sales Prediction (Regression Task)**  
- **What it does:**  
  Predicts future sales based on historical data, including features such as month, pricing, and promotions.
- **How it works:**  
  Regression algorithms like Linear Regression or Random Forest predict continuous values (e.g., sales numbers) based on input features.

## **2. Unsupervised Learning**

### **Definition:**  
In unsupervised learning, the data is unlabeled, and the goal is to find hidden patterns or structures in the data.

### **Examples of Practical Applications:**

### **2.1 Customer Segmentation (Clustering Task)**  
- **What it does:**  
  Groups customers into distinct segments based on purchasing habits, demographics, etc.
- **How it works:**  
  Algorithms like K-means or DBSCAN form clusters of similar customers based on input features such as purchase history and age.

### **2.2 Anomaly Detection in Network Traffic (Outlier Detection Task)**  
- **What it does:**  
  Detects unusual or suspicious network activities (such as hacking attempts) by identifying deviations from normal traffic patterns.
- **How it works:**  
  Algorithms like Isolation Forest or One-Class SVM detect outliers by modeling typical network behaviors and flagging unusual instances.

## **3. Reinforcement Learning**

### **Definition:**  
In reinforcement learning, an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment, receiving rewards for good actions, and penalties for bad actions.

### **Examples of Practical Applications:**

### **3.1 Game AI (Self-Play and Strategy Development)**  
- **What it does:**  
  Learns to play games like Chess or Go and improves performance through trial and error.
- **How it works:**  
  Algorithms like Q-Learning or Deep Q-Networks (DQN) train the agent by rewarding it for winning strategies and penalizing poor decisions.

### **3.2 Autonomous Vehicles (Self-Driving Cars)**  
- **What it does:**  
  Helps autonomous vehicles make decisions in real time (e.g., when to stop, accelerate, or change lanes).
- **How it works:**  
  Reinforcement learning models simulate different driving scenarios where rewards are given for safe and efficient driving behavior.
